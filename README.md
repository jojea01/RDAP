Repository for R Online Shopper DAP

This dataset contains 12,330 instances with 17 features, capturing information about customer web activity when they are in the process of searching for a product purchase, collected from Google Analytics. The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a customer will make a successful purchase. One of the main challenges in this dataset is that the data is unbalanced. Where 85% of the records indicate that a customer did not make a purchase.
Our target variable for the models will be Revenue, which indicates whether a customer made a purchase. The key features used in our models will include Bounce Rate (the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page), Exit Rate (the percentage of page views that were the last in a session), and Page Value (the average revenue associated with a page based on transactions).
The methods we will use are Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and a Decision Tree. These three methods offer a diverse range of modeling approaches, allowing us to compare their performance and improve each model to determine the most effective one.
